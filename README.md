# Advancements in Leukemia Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques
Repository for the FYP - ML in Healthcare

Leukemia, in particular Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, is a common and fatal disease form that mostly affects adolescents and children. Leukemia treatment choices and patient outcomes needs to be determined based on an accurate and early diagnosis. The present diagnosis procedure entails a number of complicated laboratory tests, which can be costly, time-consuming, and prone to human error. As a result, it is evident that automated diagnosis strategies are needed. One such technique is computer-aided microscopic morphological examination employing machine learning (ML) and image processing techniques.

This research introduces a new methodology to classify acute leukemia blast cells in microscopic images. The suggested approach consists of image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The suggested systems for the ALL_IDB2 dataset include a SVM classifier, RGB colour and gray-level histogram-based approach, GLGM, and Tamura. A 10-fold cross-validation using a Naive Bayes learner was utilised to evaluate feature sets in the SFS wrapper approach for feature selection. The ROI, namely the WBC nucleus, was segmented using various segmentation techniques, such as OTSU thresholding, morphological operations, border cleaning and flooding, masking, and cropping.

The SVM recommended system showed a good performance of 92.31% accuracy. Two CNN algorithms were proposed for feature extraction and classification of the segmented images based on the transfer learning approach. These included the ResNet50 and Xception models, which produced high accuracy results of 96.15% for ResNet50 and 94.23% for Xception. The third part of the proposed systems included two hybrid CNN-SVM technologies, ResNet50 + SVM and Xception + SVM. These hybrid approaches produced interesting results, namely ResNet50 + SVM achieved 100%, while Xception + SVM produced 84.62%.

The next part of the proposed systems included developing a classification system on the segmented images by utilizing the novel ViT, which is deep learning architecture originating from the transformer algorithm for natural language processing tasks. This approach showed an overall performance of 86.54%.
